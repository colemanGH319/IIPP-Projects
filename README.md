# Interactive Programming in Python

## About
This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of Rice University's "Interactive Programming in Python" course offered through Coursera.

## Installation
These games were initially designed to run in Rice University's web-based [Codeskulptor](www.codeskulptor.org) IDE which featured several custom packages for GUIs and data visualization. They can be run on a local machine by installing the SimpleGUICS2Pygame module:

`pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame`
